POSSIBLE STRATEGIES

Picking Starting Regions
---
* Choose superregion with highest ratio of bonus/regions (Most efficient)
	- Try using (bonus/(region^2)) - this way it's armies per region AND factors in the total number of regions

* Choose superregion with lowest count of border regions (Most defendable)

* Choose superregion with border regions close together (Most flexible)


Picking Army Placement
---
1) Choose regions with potentially dangerous numbers of enemy armies adjacent, up to an amount that makes them not dangerous (i.e. can't conquer it in the next turn)

2a) Any remainders go into regions adjacent to enemy/neutral regions in any superregion we don't have a region in yet
2b) If we can't move into a new superregion, then any remainders go into regions adjacent to enemy/neutral regions in the next most desirable superregion


Picking Army Movement
---
1) Assign a "height" to each region, where height 1 means there is an enemy region adjacent, and every other region is 1 greater than its highest neighbor
	- Iterate through and assign all height 1's first, then all 2's, all 3's, etc

2) For frontline regions => If an adjacent enemy region can be conquered without using so many armies that this one could be taken next turn, then attack, otherwise do not move
	- If a SINGLE adjacent enemy region cannot be conquered by this one, but we have another region adjacent to the enemy that COULD conquer it after this one weakens it, then attack
	- Requires tracking which of our regions have already attacked
	
3) For internal regions => Regions that are not height 1 should move all their armies to the neighbor with the lowest height
